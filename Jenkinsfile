 *
 * This Jenkinsfile outlines the build pipeline for a Java project. 
 * It serves as a foundational blueprint for this project's 
 * continuous integration process, mirroring the structure of my pipelines 
 * I have previously created. The actual execution commands are omitted 
 * for simplicity.
 *
 * Important considerations for this pipeline include:
 * - Log locations: Ensure logs are stored in secure, accessible locations.
 * - File and folder permissions: Adjust as necessary for security.
 * - User permissions: Ensure appropriate access control for pipeline stages.
 * - External logging (Splunk): Configure if external logging is required.
 * - Monitoring (Dynatrace): Set up for performance tracking and alerts.
