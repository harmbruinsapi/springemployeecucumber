# Assignment Test automation Engineer

## Standalone java application

·        Ignore security handling in it (can we discuss face-to-face)

·        Use Java 8 and/ or 11 API. **Was not possible. But after mail it was not required**

·        Framework (Spring or Spring boot) Done

·        Architecture (MVC preferred)

·        Data must be persisted in a database


·        Your code should be production-ready i.e., exception handling, logging, interaction with any Db, etc.

Objective

·        Create automated test cases for:

·        Unit test:

o   Employeeservice

o   SearchService

·        Integration test (ITs)

o   EmployeeEndpoint CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete)

o   SearchEndpoint

Make sure that a description of the it tests cases given, either in the java code files as a comment or use cucumber

·        Create a Jenkins pipeline script that will run the test automatically.

We would like to receive the complete project with the added tests and the Jenkins pipeline script.

Please also add the steps you have taken in your thought process.

Good Luck.

Note: Human Inference has integration test written in RestAssured for the DataHub product and in ReadyAPI for the DataPlatform product.
